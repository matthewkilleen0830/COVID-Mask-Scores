# Self-Reported Mask Wearing and COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by County

Core Message: &nbsp;We aim to determine the correlation between self-reported mask-wearing behavior per U.S. county and COVID-19 case rate and death rate per county as of July 14, 2020.

1. &nbsp;The questions we found interesting:
  - Is there a correlation between COVID cases per 100,000 pop. and:
    - lower mask-wearing score?
    - higher population density?
  - Is there a correlation between mask-wearing score and population density?
  - Is there a correlation between COVID deaths per 100,000 pop. and:
    - lower mask-wearing score?
    - higher population density?

2. &nbsp;Findings:
  - Is there a correlation between COVID cases per 100,000 pop. and:
    - lower mask-wearing score? &nbsp;There is a correlation, but it’s in the opposite direction we thought! &nbsp;There are more cases in counties with higher mask-wearing scores.
    - higher population density? &nbsp;There are more cases in counties with higher population densities.
  - Is there a correlation between mask-wearing score and population density? &nbsp;Counties with higher population densities self-reported better mask-wearing scores.
  - Is there a correlation between COVID deaths per 100,000 pop. and:
    - lower mask-wearing score? &nbsp;There is a correlation, but again it’s in the opposite direction we thought. &nbsp;There are more deaths in counties with higher mask-wearing scores.
    - higher population density? &nbsp;There are more cases in counties with higher population densities.
