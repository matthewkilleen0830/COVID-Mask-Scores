# Self-Reported Mask Wearing and COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by County

Core Message: We aim to determine the correlation between self-reported mask-wearing behavior per U.S. county and COVID-19 case rate and death rate per county as of July 14, 2020.

1.	The questions we found interesting:
a.	Is there a correlation between COVID cases per 100,000 pop. and:
i.	lower mask-wearing score?
ii.	higher population density?
b.	Is there a correlation between mask-wearing score and population density?
c.	Is there a correlation between COVID deaths per 100,000 pop. and:
i.	lower mask-wearing score?
ii.	higher population density?

2.	Findings:
a.	Is there a correlation between COVID cases per 100,000 pop. and:
i.	lower mask-wearing score? There is a correlation, but it’s in the opposite direction we thought! There are more cases in counties with higher mask-wearing scores.
ii.	higher population density? There are more cases in counties with higher population densities.
b.	Is there a correlation between mask-wearing score and population density? Counties with higher population densities self-reported better mask-wearing scores.
c.	Is there a correlation between COVID deaths per 100,000 pop. and:
i.	lower mask-wearing score? There is a correlation, but again it’s in the opposite direction we thought. There are more deaths in counties with higher mask-wearing scores.
ii.	higher population density? There are more cases in counties with higher population densities.
